# GameOfLife

Project to create Game of Life desk ornament using Arduino Nano and 5" display.

The Game of Life, also known as Life, was devised by John Horton Conway. It's a 0 player game, meaning the evolution is determine by the initial state.

# RULES:

- Life is an infinite, 2D orthogonal grid of square "cells", each of which is in two possible states, live or dead.

- Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors that are horizontally, vertically, and diagonally adjacent.

- At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

  - Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation

  - Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives on to the next generation

  - Any live cell with greater than 3 live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation

  - Any dead with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction
